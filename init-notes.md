#Spotify Random // Pass the AUX 

##Frontend:
- Design a UI: Main flow
    - Landing page for no-token users: 
        - What the site is
        - Button that says connect to Spotify
    - Landing page for token users:
        - Use this url:
            - web share API
            - tiny-url
        - Or:
            - Button: find random
    - Once you connect via code or random:
        - if no token: send the authenticate popup
        - else: music player
            - 
- Write the HTML and CSS for that design
    - CSS framework? Tailwind
